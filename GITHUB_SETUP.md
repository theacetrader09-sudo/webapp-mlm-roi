# GitHub Repository Setup

## ✅ Completed
- Git initialized
- All files committed (148 files)
- .env files excluded from repository

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `webapp-mlm-roi` (or your preferred name)
3. **Description**: `MLM ROI System - Complete Next.js application with admin panel, user dashboard, deposits, withdrawals, investments, and referral system`
4. **Visibility**: Choose Private or Public
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

7. **After creating**, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/apple/webapp
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webapp-mlm-roi.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated, I can create the repository automatically.

## 🔐 Important Notes

- ✅ `.env` file is NOT in the repository (secure)
- ✅ All source code is committed
- ✅ Ready to push to GitHub

## 🚀 After Pushing to GitHub

Once the code is on GitHub, you can:
1. Go to Vercel: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import from GitHub
3. Select your repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!
